.. currentmodule:: sparse

Install
=======

You can install this library with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install sparse

You can also install from source from GitHub, either by pip installing
directly::

   pip install git+https://github.com/pydata/sparse

Or by cloning the repository and installing locally::

   git clone https://github.com/pydata/sparse.git
   cd sparse/
   pip install .

Note that this library is under active development and so some API churn should
be expected.
